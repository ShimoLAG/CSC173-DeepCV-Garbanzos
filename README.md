# Abstract

This project presents a desktop-based Augmented Reality (AR) application designed to mitigate student procrastination and improve focus through gamified study companions. Utilizing OpenCV and MediaPipe, the system creates an interactive virtual environment where users care for a digital pet chicken using natural hand gestures (e.g., pinching to feed or pet) rather than traditional input devices. To ensure study adherence, a YOLOv8 object detection model runs in real-time to monitor the workspace for distractions, specifically penalizing smartphone usage during focused sessions.

The application integrates the Pomodoro technique, linking academic discipline to in-game progression. Successful study intervals are rewarded with resource generation, while break periods are transformed into gesture-based AR minigames. These interactive breaks utilize computer vision to translate physical hand movements into gameplay mechanics, encouraging users to engage in brief physical activity before returning to work. By combining behavioral reinforcement with lightweight computer vision, this system demonstrates a novel, unobtrusive approach to digital wellbeing and habit formation.
